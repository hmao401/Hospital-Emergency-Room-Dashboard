# Hospital Emergency Room Dashboard (Power BI)

## Overview
This project showcases an interactive Power BI dashboard analysing Emergency Room activity over a 19-month period (April 2023 to October 2024). The aim is to demonstrate how operational healthcare data can be transformed into clear, actionable insights to support decision making around patient flow, staffing, and service performance.

The project focuses on data modelling, KPI design, and effective dashboard storytelling rather than domain-specific clinical analysis.

## Objectives
- Analyse patient volumes and trends over time
- Measure average wait times and patient satisfaction
- Identify peak demand periods by day and hour
- Understand admission patterns and referral pathways
- Explore patient demographics at a high level

## Dashboard Highlights
- Monthly and consolidated performance views
- Patient volumes and admission status tracking
- Average wait time and satisfaction score KPIs
- Time-of-day and day-of-week demand analysis
- Department referral breakdown
- Patient demographic insights by age, gender, and race

## Key Insights
- Average Emergency Room wait time is approximately 35 minutes, indicating potential capacity and flow constraints.
- Patient admissions and non-admissions are nearly evenly split, suggesting a broad mix of case severity.
- Mondays and late evening to early morning hours experience the highest patient volumes.
- General Practice and Orthopedics account for the majority of referrals.
- The highest patient volumes are observed among adults aged 20–39.

## Tools & Techniques
- Power BI
- Data cleaning and transformation
- Data modelling and relationships
- DAX measures and calculated columns
- KPI design and dashboard storytelling
